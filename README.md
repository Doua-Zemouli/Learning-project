# This is a Learning project

As you konw, every data analytics project starts from a request, which typically comes from the business people, like some sort of manager. This request is usually about providing the data to them in a simple visual manner aka a dashboard. This is crutial soft skill, because without a clear undrestanding of the request it is not possible to deliver a good dashboard! In fact if you are negligent about this part you might be wasting your work and will anger other people.
So first, go through the kick off meeting management

Goal: See if survival rate had anything to do with the passanger class. Also, assess the age of the passengers within each class to identify vulnerable age categories.

Assessment: The data analytics dashboard reveals significant differences in survival rates among various passenger classes on the Titanic. When examining the survival percentages, a substantial disparity is evident. First-class passengers had almost three times the survival rate compared to third-class passengers. This underscores the importance of analyzing survival percentages rather than merely the total number of survivors.

For first-class passengers, the survival rate is approximately 60%. However, when considering the percentage of survivors within each class, the rate is notably higher, emphasizing the critical need to differentiate between overall survival rates and class-specific survival percentages.

Age also played a significant role in survival outcomes. Second-class children had a 100% survival rate, compared to 80% for first-class and 40% for third-class children. No seniors survived in the second and third classes, while only 17% (one individual) survived in the first class. It is essential to conduct a deeper statistical analysis for the first class result to determine if this survival rate among seniors is statistically significant or due to chance.

Recommendations:

•    Focus on minimizing the disparity between passenger classes.
•    Investigate emergency accessibility measures to improve survival rates for all age categories across all classes.
•    Use these insights to initiate further data analysis (statistical analysis) to design ships that ensure more equitable safety provisions for all passengers, regardless of class or age.
